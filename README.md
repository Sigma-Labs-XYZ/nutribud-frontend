Here you see the header for the first time which you'll have access to on every page of our website we'll have a close look at this later on. In addition to the header we have a tab selector to choose whether you want to search for something you've eaten, or search for a specific barcode.

### searching

![alt text](https://github.com/Sigma-Labs-XYZ/nutribud-frontend/blob/readme-edits/readme-files/text-searchbar.png?raw=true "Text Searchbar")

When on the product name tab, you can search for vague foods, specific foods, meals or even just write a sentence such "For breakfast I had some toast" and we'll bring you a list of all items in our database to do with toast (This part is made possible with the fancy natural language processing technique).

You may have noticed this little icon in the searchbar
